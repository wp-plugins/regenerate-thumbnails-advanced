== Description ==

A plugin that makes regenerating thumbnails even easier than before and more flexible.
If you install a new theme, it might have different image sizes it wants to use. those image sizes are cropped and resized into thumbnails only when you upload new images. So what happens with your old images? 
the ones you already uploaded? They need to be regenerated, this is what this plugin does. It takes each image and generates the thumbnails for each and every one of them. 


Features:

*   You can select a period in time for the images to be regenerated from
*   The period is last day, last week, last month or all
*   Clean simple interface where you have a progress bar showing you the percentage of images regenerated
*   You get to see the total number of images affected by your period, as well as the images afected so far when processing
